Mistakes I'm Learning From

* Well I really should've thought about difference screens at first. There is a magnificent difference even from my laptop to my desktop =(
* I really need to learn where certain units are better (rem, em, px, vh, vw)
* Do not .gitignore .gitignore .... Also really think about ignoring production folders early. I was just dumb.
* If you find yourself using flex-wrap, I think that means you should go to grid. Unfortunate consequence of creating media queries for mobile screens.
* Even though I put days of work on version 1, I decided to scrap the whole thing because I wasn't really feeling it.
