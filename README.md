Mistakes I'm Learning From
- Well I really should've thought about difference screens at first. There is a magnificent difference even from my laptop to my desktop =(
- I really need to learn where certain units are better (rem, em, px, vh, vw)
- Do not .gitignore .gitignore .... Also really think about ignoring production folders early. I was just dumb.
