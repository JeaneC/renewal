      <h2 class="sub-header">Origins</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">My journey into coding started Summer 2017. I was formerly a Government and Physics major, but decided to concentrate in Mathematics after some events in 2016.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">My first major hackathon was three months later, Fall 2017, at Code For Good by JP Morgan. I kept changing my mind about going, up until the last possible second. I considered going back halfway through my two-hour commute, but <span class="bold">I decided to just show up.</span>        24 hours later I found myself jumping in the air with my team after winning the entire competition! One week later, we were offered internships into JP Morgan's Technology Analayst Program.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Talk about a lucky way to enter the field of tech?!</p>

    <div class='box'>
      <h2 class="sub-header">MLH 2018 Season</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">I wanted to keep competing. I wanted to keep learning, so I did my research and found out that there were many college hackathons by this organization called MLH.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">It would take multiple novels to describe my journey in the past 4 months, but from <span class="bold">January 2018 to April 2018 I attended 8 hackathons in 6 different states.</span> Each time I always felt like the under dog because the truth
        is, there are so many talented developers out there. But I kept finding the courage to show up.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Hackathon after another, I met people from different colleges, countries, and companies. I met recruiters and engineers from Twitter, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, JP Morgan, and other amazing companies. I also had the insane opportunity to make
        friends with programmers, entrepneurs, and anyone really. And just by coincidence, I often found myself on the finals stage with complete strangers as teammates.</p>

    <div class='box'>
      <h2 class="sub-header">Last Words</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Friends always wonder where I find the time for this, especially during the school year. I think if you're truly passionate about something, then you'll show up.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"> You'll show up even though you think there are 400 other hackers in that room better than you. You'll show up even though there are interns in Google and Facebook and students from Ivy Leagues or renown univerisities competing against you. You'll
        show up even though you think you're a terrible programmer from a college no one knows about.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">You'll show up because you're a <span class="highlight">hacker.</span></p>
